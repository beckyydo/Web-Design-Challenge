Tools: Python, HTML, CSS

The main purpose of this project was to analyze how the weather changes as you approach the equator. The data was pulled from the OpenWeatherMAP API on over 500 cities.

With the dataset and using python, the module Matplotlib was used to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. The factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. Page is spilt into 3 section; home, comparison and data. In the home page is an initial graph describing the purpose of the project.
Pictures on the side can be clicked to switch to the different data visualization of equator against the 4 weather factors. It is contains a brief summary analysis of any trends or correlations observed from the graph. The comparison page will contain the 4 graphs all together in order to compare the weather factors. The last page data provides the source data to have a look at the data plotted.
